## Work Log (5 hours each day):
Day 1: Learning more about Next.js, Typescript, Clerk, Mongoose, Vercel, ShadCn and much more. Lots and lots of wireframing. And finally icon and images creation.

Day 2: Working on the homepage and users profiles in Clerk. Lots of debugging.

Day 3: Working on setting up the backend with Mongoose as well as Deploying with Vercel. Hooray!!

Day 4: Working on the "Create Event" page as well as the "Final Summary" (and hopefully the purchase ticket page). Lots and lots of debugging this day.
