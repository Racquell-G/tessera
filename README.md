## Work Log (5 hours each day):
Day 1: Learning more about Next.js, Typescript, Clerk, Mongoose, Vercel, ShadCn and much more. Lots and lots of wireframing. And finally icon and images creation.

Day 2: Working on the homepage and layout as well as the users profiles in Clerk. Lots of debugging.

Day 3: Working on setting up the backend with Mongoose as well as deploying with Vercel. Hooray!!

Day 4: Working on the "Create Event" page as well as the "Final Summary" page (and hopefully the future purchase ticket page). Lots and lots of debugging this day.

Day 5: Wokring on the homepage again. This time focusing on displaying created events. Thinking about making edits to the wireframe I had for this page (perhaps subcategory divs such as, Recommended for You, Popular Events, Newly Created, etc).

Day 6: Made an option so that if you are the organizer you can edit and delete your event easily. It also stores the previously entered data, so that editing an event is easier. Along with that 2 more events were made and now events listed under the same category will populate in a "Related Events" section under an event you visit.

Day 7: New logo created. More representative of how the platform operates.Also spent time researching how to implement a seating chart for events. However this is just a start.

Day 8: Began working on re-wireframing the My Profile page after the inital one.

Day 9: Modified events page a little so that it doesn't get overcrowded. Also began working on my profile page.
